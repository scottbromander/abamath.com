          Classroom Procedures
    </h2>
    <h3>Behavior Policies</h3>
    <h4>Important Teaching Concepts That Will Help in the Classroom</h4>
    <p>Preview the class </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: “We are taking a break in TWO minutes!”</li>
      <li>
        Example: “When I say go you’re going to stand up, push in your chair, and line up
        at the door. From there, we are going to take a bathroom break as a class followed
        by our 15 to 20 minute break outside.” Before giving your ‘go’ signal, pause a moment
        to let their mental movie play out. Then challenge your class. “Is there anyone who
        doesn’t know exactly what to do when I say go?” Then pause yet again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Way to get attention:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Say, “1 2 3, eyes on me” and they respond, “1 2, eyes on you”</li>
      <li>
        With the younger kids, have them make mouth bubbles/”put a marshmallow
        in your mouth” where the kids inflate their cheeks. It gets their attention
        and stops them from talking over you
      </li>
      <li>What color are my eyes/glasses/etc.?</li>
      <li>
          “If you hear me clap once… If you hear me clap twice…
          If you hear my clap three times…”
      </li>
      <li>Count backwards from 4</li>
      <li>Have students stand and stretch, then sit and get started </li>
      <li>
        “The noise level so far has cost us two minutes of break time.”
        Then hold up the number of minutes they have lost and wait for the
        silence, adding more minutes if it continues a long time.
      </li>
      <li>Flash lights </li>
      <li> For elementary schoolers, if you say X, they say Y</li>
      <ul>
        <li>“All on board → Aye aye captain!” (kids can salute)</li>
        <li>“Ready to rock → Ready to roll!” (kids can fist pump)</li>
        <li>“Are you ready? → I was born ready!” (kids can make karate pose)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Do what I do / Simon says: Have students continue to do what you do until you
        have all of their attention (pat head, rub stomach, tap ears, etc)
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>How to Transition a Class</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple Procedure</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure students’ attention: “Focus on me please” </li>
        <li>Explain the procedure: “In a moment, we are going to transition to break time.”</li>
        <li>
          Prepare kids for the signal to start:
          “When I say ‘smooth,’ you’ll quietly proceed.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Initiate the transition: “And...smooth.”
          Don’t say ‘go’ because that word cues students to race.
        </li>
        <li>Observe: Watch to make sure all students are complying.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Slowly counting down from five never fails to accelerate transitions. </li>
      <li>
        Right before a transition,
        ask a student to describe the proper transition procedure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Play “correct the teacher” and perform examples and non-examples of behavior
        while the students indicate if something is wrong by putting a thumbs down.
        Then call on someone to articulate the right procedure.
      </li>
      <li>
        When students don’t want to quit what they’re doing, it’s probably because
        they felt blindsided. This can be corrected and prevented by having a visible
        countdown timer as well as verbal reminders of when transitions will happen.
      </li>
      <li>
        You could play a song like “I like to move it, move it” to signal that it is
        time to change activities.
      </li>
      <li>Give students a time limit for transitions</li>
      <li>
        When transitioning back to the classroom, stop at the drinking fountain and
        bathroom first so that they have that time to calm down before walking back
        into the classroom.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>A kid having a bad attitude the whole class</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, tell them you will take away privileges, like computer time, break time,
        talking to their parents, or talking to another school official/camp official.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the situation worsens, then start to follow through on taking these privileges
        away and/or contacting their parents or a school official/camp official.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a break chair - Not a timeout, because the time doesn’t matter. The point
        is to allow the student to take time to think about why they needed a break.
        When they come back, they need to discuss what ideas they have to help them
        stay a part of the class and stay on task.
      </li>
      <li>Deep Breaths</li>
      <li>Coloring</li>
      <li>
        Red/Green Card - A student needs to ask if they would like to talk by turning
        the card to green. The instructor can give the student the floor or turn the
        card back to red (can use a playing card if that is easier/on hand)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Swearing or inappropriate comments</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First incident: Warning. Let them know that those words may be okay in a
        different setting, but not this one.
      </li>
      <li>Second incident: Warning with note or call home </li>
      <li>Tips:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>“We don’t talk like that to each other.” </li>
        <li>
          “In this classroom we use formal language. The word you used is considered a
          swear room in my classroom and I don’t want to hear it again.”
        </li>
        <li>Ask them a different way to express their thought</li>
        <li>“Language please!”</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Behavioral Examples and Solutions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Lying</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are 3 main reasons why children lie: to get attention, to avoid
            getting in trouble, and to feel better about themselves. Distinguishing
            the reason for the lie can help you determine the best course of action.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you catch a student in a lie, ask, “Is that really what happened or
            what you wish would have happened?” Give the student an extra consequence
            for lying. Emphasize the importance of honesty and if they respond honestly,
            say, “I’m so proud of you for being honest about being on another website
            when I told you no. I’m still going to take 2 minutes away from your break
            today, but because you told the truth, I won’t take away any from tomorrow.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Let them know that unless they tell the truth,
            people won’t believe what they say.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Defiance </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether your student ignores you when you say you they need to get off the
            computers or doesn’t line up when break is over, defiance is a difficult
            behavior to address. It’s normal for kids to test limits at one time or
            another.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a student is being defiant, offer a single if… then warning. “If you
            don’t line up at the door right now, I will turn off your computer and you
            will lose two minutes at the start of break time.”
          </li>
          <li>
            If the student doesn’t comply after the warning, follow through with your
            consequence. With consistency, your students will learn to listen the
            first time you ask.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another way to handle defiance is offering choices: “We can go outside
            today or play board game inside for break.” They have to choose one or the
            other.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Disrespectful Behavior</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples include name calling, throwing things, or mocking you</li>
          <li>
            If the student’s intention is to get attention, ignoring can be the best
            course of action. Make it clear that sticking his or her tongue out at
            you from across the classroom isn’t going to get the reaction they are
            looking for.
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s important to give immediate consequences for most disrespectful
            behavior, however. If a student calls you or another student a name,
            take away a privilege or send him or her to the take-a-break chair.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Whining</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A good first course of action is ignoring. Show the student that whining
            won’t get you to change your mind. Give him or her positive attention
            when they stop whining.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Blurting out excessively </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Give the student an alternative to blurting out. Have him or her raise
            their hand, and in return, make sure you call on them right away to
            reinforce the positive behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            Give the student a writing pad or a piece of paper to write their comments
            down. Take time to discuss it later with them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Interrupting </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Even if students are excited to talk, interrupting teaches them that they
            are entitled to immediate attention.
          </li>
          <li>
            Show your students that you’ll pay full attention to them after you’ve
            finished talking with another student.
          </li>
          <li>
            If needed, gently turn to the student and briefly say, “I am talking
            with __ at the moment and will talk to you after. Until then, you need
            to be patient.”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Disruptive </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The best way to combat disruptive behavior is to have structure and
            guidelines. Children need boundaries and consequences for poor choices.
            By consistently having a goal in mind for the students, they will hopefully
            be less disruptive and more focused. Change class time up frequently. Are
            your students bored? Have them stand up and stretch for a few minutes. Have
            they been working for an hour? Take a break and play a game with them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>How do we handle a child&#39;s misuse of the internet? </h4>
    <p>
      *** Use as a guideline! Situations may vary, especially with kids who have ADHD
      or other conditions, so make sure to account for those factors ***
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Less severe </li>
      <ul>
        <li>First incident: warning</li>
        <li>Second incident: warning with note or call home </li>
        <li>Third incident: warning with note or call home </li>
        <li>Fourth incident: termination of class </li>
      </ul>
      <li>More severe </li>

    <h4>What do we do if it does seem like one kid is being bullied? </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <OutboundLink href="https://www.smartclassroommanagement.com/2011/06/25/bullying-in-the-classroom/">Resource on Bullying</OutboundLink>
        {' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        Know what bullying is: “Bullying is the strong preying upon the weak. It can be
        a physical advantage or a social advantage. It can be one student or many. It
        often takes the form of threats, intimidation, repeated cruelty, and/or forcing
        someone against his or her will to do what the bully wants.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate bully from those bullied immediately: “Once you’re clear on the facts
        of the incident, and know who is responsible, act immediately. Separate the bully
        or bullies from their classmates in an in-class time-out. Tell them why, but don’t
        lecture, scold, raise your voice, or even ask for a response.”
      </li>
      <li>Speak to the bully’s parents and the victim’s parents. </li>
      <li>Keep a close eye on both the bully and the victim for the rest of the week. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      What if a child is not at all interested?
      (Ex. Just wants to sit in the corner and read)
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Really tough to answer. Situational. Ideally, finding something the student can
        be excited by. At end of first day, discussing with parent.
      </li>
      <li>These kids will have phones. What if there is a prolonged amount of use on them? </li>
      <li>Only allowed use during breaks</li>
      <li>
        It may be best to have a strategy of collecting phones at the beginning of
        class and then returning them during breaks. Luke is okay with requiring the
        student to give up their phone if they are unable to refrain from using it.
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Parent Policies</h3>
    <h4>What if a parent is being a bother? What if they want to sit in and watch us teach? </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For safety reasons, I would suggest no parents are allowed to sit in and watch
        unless Luke is present. Someone needs to be around to “escort” him or her, and
        with an instructor teaching, that would leave us out of that position to do so.
        We never know what kind of dangers or situations could arise from a parent. We can
        kindly tell them that there is an opportunity to see what their child is doing on
        Thursday when they can come in and see what they did. Also tell them that it
        is for safety purposes that they cannot sit in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternative answer: Let them stay for 30 minutes tops. From my own experience,
        I feel uncomfortable when a parents tries to watch me teach. It feels like they
        are stepping on my toes and like I no longer have authority over the class (could
        be an age thing).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Checkout Policies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Site for check ins:
        {' '}
        <OutboundLink href="https://abamath-check-in.herokuapp.com/#!/">here</OutboundLink>
        {' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        At the beginning of class, you should know/ask a district official how the
        check-in/checkout system of the district works. Some districts have a camp system
        that will determine where you pick up and drop off the kids.
      </li>
      <li>
        For districts without a camp system, the kids will most likely be dropped off
        in the classroom by the parents. You should determine by the first parent where
        you will drop off the kids/have them picked up in the classroom to keep consistency
        for the remaining parents.
      </li>
      <li>At the end of the day, you must make sure the students’ spaces are clean.</li>
      <li>
        If the parents pick up the child in the classroom, you and the other instructor(s)
        wait for every child to be picked up from the classroom
      </li>
      <li>
        If you walk the kids to a designated area, make sure you and the other
        instructor(s) walk the kids to that location together. You and the other
        instructor(s) must stay and watch to make sure every child gets picked up by
        the correct car.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>If we have a bad feeling about who is picking a child up.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Parents should have to sign their child in and out unless they write a note
        with their signature saying otherwise. To pick up a child, a parent or guardian
        should have their ID (remind them of this when they drop off their kid), and on our
        roster we should have a list of eligible pick-up people. If someone comes in and
        tries to pick up their child and their name is not on the list, we call someone
        who is on the list to confirm if it is okay or not. Instructor or parent then
        writes down the time the child arrives and leaves. This could be helpful for
        legal reasons if we are blamed for something during a time we were not in charge
        of the kid. Safety should be our number one priority and although it may be more
        of a hassle for parents and us as well, I think they will appreciate our attention
        to detail and safety in doing so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get a school official, if necessary. It is always safe to have multiple people
        involved in a situation like this.
      </li>
      <li>
        Definitely call police if we have a bad feeling about someone picking a child up.
        If you have a co-instructor, ask for their judgment on the situation as well
        before calling.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Emergency Policies</h3>
    <h4>First aid</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I think CPR/First Aid training would be a good investment for this company to make
        with their instructors. It’s possible some people have an up-to-date certification
        already. I believe it’s as crucial as running a background check.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>First aid examples</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Tweezers - use to take out splinters or bee stingers </li>
      <li>
        Ice pack - use if a child is complaining of a pain or after they get stung
        by a bee
      </li>
      <li>BandAids - use for minor scrapes and bumps </li>
      <li>HydroCortisone - use for minor pains, swelling, itching, and discomfort </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Emergency situations - if there was a fire, tornado, etc. </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Typically, rosters can be found on Eleyo. Every instructor should print a hard
        copy roster of their class with names, allergies/important information, emergency
        contact information, and parents/guardian names before the class starts.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of a fire, escort your class to a safe location and
        count your kids / check your roster when you arrive. Let someone know if you
        don’t have your whole class. Never leave the kids alone. By having parents sign
        their child in and out, we can quickly see if a child didn’t come that day or
        if they are indeed somewhere else.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of a tornado, escort your class to a safe location and count your
        kids / check your roster when you arrive. Let someone know if you don’t have
        your whole class. Never leave the kids alone. By having parents sign their
        child in and out, we can quickly see if a child didn’t come that day or if
        they are indeed somewhere else.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of an active shooter situation, your best option is leave the building
        and don’t be a sitting duck. Getting away from the shooter or shooters is top
        priority. Leave everything except your roster behind. Help other escape, if
        possible, but evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Prevent your
        class from going where the active shooter may be. Call 911 when you are safe.
      </li>
      <li>
        If leaving isn’t an option, hide. Tell your class to stay very quiet and ensure
        that all phones are off and won’t vibrate. Lock and block doors, close blinds,
        and turn off the lights. Don’t hide in groups; spread out along wall or hide
        separately to make it harder for the shooter. Try to communicate silently with
        the police by sending a text or tagging your location on social media. Stay in
        place until you get the all clear from officials.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lost child procedure?</h4>
    <li>
      Hasn’t happened. Immediate outreach to community education. Could depend on
      how/when it happened.
    </li>


    <h3>Other Policies</h3>
    <h4>Bathroom procedures and rules</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Try to bring the whole group during designated break time (at least one every
        90 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        If there are 2 instructors and it’s not break time, one instructor can ask for
        a bathroom call. Always bring more than one child even if only one has to go.
        If it’s an emergency and it’s only you, bring the whole class.
      </li>
      <li>Never go into a stall with a child, even with it unlocked. </li>
      <li>
        Shouldn’t be a problem with our age groups, but if a younger child is having a
        hard time zipping or buttoning their pants, try to talk them through it. If there
        is an absolute need for help, have another adult be a spotter. This is important
        for child safety.

    <h4>What do we do with extra time? </h4>
    <ul><li>Typically extend free work time, or look to ICE plans</li></ul>
    <h4>Printing Policy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Who prints: The person in charge of printing will be assigned for the summer</li>
      <li>
        Where to print: The printing person may choose a location to print (ie local
        library or FedEx/OfficeMax), location should be used consistently.
      </li>
      <li>
        One-time prints: For one time prints (eg a new activity/curriculum update),
        email the document and number of copies needed to the printing person.
        These will be distributed at Team Tuesday meeting
      </li>
      <li>Recurring prints(eg end of class handouts/flyers): </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Strategy 1: Each week, on Friday, instructors should email the printing
          person with the documents they need and the number of copies(based on
          their roster and including copies for potential last minute adds).
          These will be distributed on Team Tuesday
        </li>
        <li>
          Strategy 2: Have the printing person do the work outlined above for all
          instructors for the week
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
