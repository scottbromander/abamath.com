## Contributing to this Project

That would be amazing! In 3 months, we made a substantial conversion from AngularJS 1.2 to Gatsby 1.0 and the to Gatsby 2.0, so it's been a pretty crazy ride and there's still tons to do.

We'd love your Pull Requests! Check out our [branching documentation](/documentation/branching.md) to learn more.
