        3-Hour Code Championship
      </h1>
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>
        Attention girls and boys, the March Madness of coding has arrived;
        all the excitement of a tournament packed into one day! Spend the
        day building out an artificial intelligence computer bot to play
        head-to-head against your peers! To keep an even playing field,
        the details of the game are kept secret until the day of the
        championship. Spend the first hour learning coding fundamentals
        then, the fun begins when the challenge is released. Create an
        artificial intelligence computer bot to play head to head against
        other bots in a tournament. Internet navigation skills (basic
        typing and mouse control), a passion to work hard and have fun
        are required.

      <h4>Timeline</h4>
      <p>3-hour day for 4th-7th graders</p>

      <h4>Objectives</h4>
      <p>To be able to create a bot using Scratch</p>
      <p>To be able to compete head-to-head against other students using code</p>

      <h4>Terminology</h4>
      <p>Coders - Students enrolled in the class</p>
      <p>Referee/You - Instructor leading the class</p>

      <h4>Basic Structure</h4>
      <p>
        Each day consists of multiple guided instruction sections where
        the coach will lead the coders through a Scratch example and then
        be given time to improve that example and make it their own with
        the instructor offering assistance and answering questions. On the
        final day, there is no guided instruction in order to give students
        time to complete their “Final Project”.

          Explanation of the Vacuum challenge:
          There are two bots on the screen at a time. Game Rules:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>You will be disqualified if you don’t follow these rules: </li>

            <li>You may not change the background </li>
            <li>You may not generate other sprites </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Your bot will not work if: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>You do change the name of the sprite. It has to be “Player 1”</li>
            <li>You are editing “Player 2” </li>

          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Improvement Time - 60 minutes</li>
        <li>Bio-Break Time - 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Stretches</li>
        <li>
          Improvement Time - 30 minutes -
          students may test there bots against others on their computer, or on
          the projector
        </li>

          Bracket Challenge - For large class,
          create a single-elimination bracket. For a small class, every

        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note: Round robin without keeping score keeps things competitive,
            but not too competitive.
            Round robin with 6 students took 30 minutes.
