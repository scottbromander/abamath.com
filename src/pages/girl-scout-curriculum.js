      <h3>Think Like a Programmer</h3>
      <h5>Girls learn and apply computational thinking:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the Problem</li>
        <li>Break it into smaller chunks</li>
        <li>Look for patterns</li>
        <li>Identify a solution that works for everyone </li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Girls learn: You can solve big problems by taking it step-by-step!</h5>

      <h3>Goals set by Abamath:</h3>
      <h5>Less focus on the nuts and bolts of coding</h5>
      <h5>General understanding of how coding is used in the real world</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Names/Name Tags</li>
          <li>Coding Experience</li>
          <li>Favorite thing to do on the computer</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Rules and coder expectations</li>
        <li>Tell the scouts that there will be break time and what time it will be</li>
        <li>
          Mars Rover (20 minutes) - Ask for a volunteer to be the Rover. The Rover should close
          their eyes and stand at the front of the room/hallway. Have other scouts create a path
          using their chairs as boundaries. Place 3 objects throughout the course. Taking turns,
          the student should direct the Rover(whose eyes are still closed) through the obstacles
          to retrieve and bring back all the objects. Tell the class that they cannot touch the
          Rover or move the 3 objects. If there are 2+ instructors, one can be the rover and
          the other can moderate.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Additional play version: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Have teams of 2. Time each team with the players giving the robot
              instructions. 1 point per second and 5 for every obstacles encountered
            </li>
            <li>
              Have teams trying to reach specific locations first, or have them try to
              obtain objects (ex. markers). First team to reach all the locations/pick
              up all the objects win!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Questions to ask scouts:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>What was the big problem there?</li>
            <li>How did we break the problem down?</li>
            <li>
              How did it feel to be the robot? How did it feel to be giving the
              robot instructions?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Scouts make code.org accounts (30 minutes) </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Recommended with small classes to write down login information as scouts
            usually have trouble logging on the second day
          </li>
          <li>Do not log any emails or passwords if the student already uses them personally.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Busy Day Activity (15 minutes)- As a busy girl scout, they probably have a long list of
          things to accomplish each week. Walk the dog, brush teeth, meet up with friends, do
          homework. That makes prioritizing really hard! This activity will help the girls go
          through the problem-solving process in steps.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Have scouts write down a list of the things they have to do for the week.
            They should keep writing until 5 minutes has passed
          </li>
          <li>Then give the girls 3 minutes to prioritize their tasks</li>
          <li>As a group, discuss the different methods used:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>How did they break the tasks into groups</li>
            <li>What patterns did they follow (eg school first, then friends, then chores) </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Relate this back to creating a website: we need to determine all the long list of things
          to put on our website. Then we chunk them into groups and complete.
        </li>
        <li>Code time (30 minutes)</li>
        <li>
          Conditionals Competition (15 minutes)- Split scouts into 2 teams. The person at the
          front of the line will pick up a card and show it to the instructor. They will then
          perform the appropriate action based on the card&#39;s conditions. If they are correct,
          the team gets a point. If not, the card goes back in the stack. Continue until all
          cards are complete.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you don&#39;t have a set of cards, the prompts can be found

        <li>Conditionals Card Game (30 minutes) - Have scouts break into pairs</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each pair should get a piece of paper. Tell scouts they have 15 minutes to write
            out the rules in a if(condition) format to a card game. They can reference a
            card game they know or, for more fun, make their own! But be careful to keep
            track of time (announce every five minutes)
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the paris have completed this, they may have 15 minutes to play another
            team&#39;s games. If it seems some are boring of this, have them switch again before
            the 15 minutes is over
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Break (60 minutes)</li>
        <ul><li>Halfway through</li></ul>
        <li>
          Just Dance loops activity (30 minutes) - Begin the activity by reminding students that
          we see loops in real life all the time. Have students break into groups of 2/3. One at
          a time, have the students complete one of the Just Dance videos on YouTube. After the
          song is over, ask each student to define a loop they used when dancing. When all
          students have gone, emphasize the difference between repeat loops and conditional
          loops. For example, in the songs, we weren&#39;t counting how many times we did a certain
          action. Instead, we did it UNTIL a condition (ie a change in rhythm) was satisfied.

        <li>Code Time (30 minutes)</li>
        <li>Pattern Tracking Game (30 minutes) - Have scouts break into 2 teams</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Set up: Remind scouts that in coding, we look for patterns and repetition to
            make our code simple to follow. Explain that, for this game, we are looking
            for absolute patterns (patterns that continue throughout the whole program in
            the exact form).
          </li>
          <li>
            Line the teams up. The person in front of each line gets a fly swatter. When
            the question is displayed on the board, the first player to hit the correct
            answer, scores a point for their team
          </li>
          <li>
            The scout who buzzes in first must explain their answer. If the answer
            contradicts the listed answer but the scout still presents a good explanation,
            the instructor may award her/them the point
          </li>
          <li>
            At the end, note that with the code block examples, we found patterns in some
            of them. This means we can use loops to make our code more precise

          Sorting (30 minutes)Give the coders eight cards (Ace through 8, out of order). The
          coders take turns asking about two cards. They can ask, “Which card is larger?” or
          “Are these cards in order?” and then the next coder can ask. Here are two methods for
          comparison:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Best if done in group of 4/5 in a circle fashion. Give students an incentive
            (ie break) if they get it in less than 15 turns
          </li>

            <OutboundLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">Merge sort: </OutboundLink>
            First divide the
            list into the smallest unit (1 element), then compare
            each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists.
            Finally all the elements are sorted and merged.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bubble sort: repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair
            of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
          </li>
          <li>Quick sort:</li>
          <ul>
            <li> Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array. </li>
            <li>
              Partitioning: reorder the array so that all elements with values less than
              the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than
              the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this
              partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition
              operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller
              values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.

          Make a Picture (30 minutes) - Each student is given a sheet of graph paper and
          instructions on how to create an image on their graph paper. Give students 10
          minutes to complete their drawing
        </li>
        <ul>

            Instructions found here (Algorithm results in order: monkey,
            camel, elephant, cat)
          </li>
          <li>
            When students are done, have them compare the image and the original side by side and
            discuss unclear program terms.
          </li>
          <li>If they would like, students may try with another set of instructions</li>
