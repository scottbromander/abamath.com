            Power up computers immediately upon arrival. Some will have a long startup process
            (Leave a couple extra computers logged on if another crashes during the class).
      </li>
      <li>
        Find/Read Emergency Procedures for the classroom or ask the community ed director about
        emergency procedures
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask what the expectations of instructors are for their district
        (they are all different).
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask for the Check-In Procedure: Do you pick up the students,
        or do they get dropped off in the classroom?
      </li>
      <li>Ask the community ed director if and where they can go outside for break</li>
      <li>Find where the nearest bathrooms and drinking fountains are</li>
      <li>Verify the pick up procedure at the end of the day</li>
      <li>Do you wait for the kids or do the school officials?</li>
      <li>Do you bring the kids somewhere or keep them in the classroom?</li>
      <li>
        When the parents drop the children off, introduce yourself and thank them for
        being in the class. Explain the pickup process and encourage them to bring a snack
        and earbuds the next day (if the school where you are teaching does not provide them.)
      </li>
