        <h4>Important Teaching Concepts That Will Help in the Classroom</h4> 
        <p>Preview the class </p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Example: “We are taking a break in TWO minutes!”</li>
                <li>Example: “When I say go you’re going to stand up, push in your chair, and line up 
                    at the door. From there, we are going to take a bathroom break as a class followed
                     by our 15 to 20 minute break outside.” Before giving your ‘go’ signal, pause a moment
                      to let their mental movie play out. Then challenge your class. “Is there anyone who 
                      doesn’t know exactly what to do when I say go?” Then pause yet again. </li>
                      </ul>
        <p>Way to get attention:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Say, “1 2 3, eyes on me” and they respond, “1 2, eyes on you”</li> 
                    <li>With the younger kids, have them make mouth bubbles/”put a marshmallow 
                        in your mouth” where the kids inflate their cheeks. It gets their attention 
                        and stops them from talking over you</li>
                    <li>What color are my eyes/glasses/etc.?</li> 
                    <li>“If you hear me clap once… If you hear me clap twice… If you hear my clap three
                         times…” </li>
                    <li>Count backwards from 4</li>
                    <li>Have students stand and stretch, then sit and get started </li>
                    <li>“The noise level so far has cost us two minutes of break time.” 
                        Then hold up the number of minutes they have lost and wait for the 
                        silence, adding more minutes if it continues a long time. </li> 
                    <li>Flash lights </li> 
                    <li> For elementary schoolers, if you say X, they say Y</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“All on board → Aye aye captain!” (kids can salute)</li>
                            <li>“Ready to rock → Ready to roll!” (kids can fist pump)</li>
                            <li>“Are you ready? → I was born ready!” (kids can make karate pose)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Do what I do / Simon says: Have students continue to do what you do until you 
                        have all of their attention (pat head, rub stomach, tap ears, etc) </li> 

                        </ul>
            <p>How to Transition a Class</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple Procedure</li> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Secure students’ attention: “Focus on me please” </li>
                        <li>Explain the procedure: “In a moment, we are going to transition to 
                            break time.”</li>
                        <li>Prepare kids for the signal to start: “When I say ‘smooth,’ you’ll 
                            quietly proceed.” </li>
                        <li>Initiate the transition: “And...smooth.” Don’t say ‘go’ because that 
                            word cues students to race. </li>
                        <li>Observe: Watch to make sure all students are complying. </li>

                        </ul>

                    <li>Slowly counting down from five never fails to accelerate transitions. </li>
                    <li>Right before a transition, ask a student to describe the proper transition
                         procedure. </li>
                    <li>Play “correct the teacher” and perform examples and nonexamples of behavior
                         while the students indicate if something is wrong by putting a thumbs down. 
                         Then call on someone to articulate the right procedure. </li>
                    <li>When students don’t want to quit what they’re doing, it’s probably because 
                        they felt blindsided. This can be corrected and prevented by having a visible
                         countdown timer as well as verbal reminders of when transitions will happen. </li>
                    <li>You could play a song like “I like to move it, move it” to signal that it is
                         time to change activities. </li>
                    <li>Give students a time limit for transitions</li>
                    <li>When transitioning back to the classroom, stop at the drinking fountain and 
                        bathroom first so that they have that time to calm down before walking back 
                        into the classroom. </li>
                    </ul>
            <h4>A kid having a bad attitude the whole class</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, tell them you will take away privileges, like computer time, break time, 
                        talking to their parents, or talking to another school official/camp official. </li>
                    <li>If the situation worsens, then start to follow through on taking these privileges
                         away and/or contacting their parents or a school official/camp official.</li>
                    <li>Take a break chair - Not a timeout, because the time doesn’t matter. The point 
                        is to allow the student to take time to think about why they needed a break. 
                        When they come back, they need to discuss what ideas they have to help them 
                        stay a part of the class and stay on task. </li>
                    <li>Deep Breaths</li>
                    <li>Coloring</li>
                    <li>Red/Green Card - A student needs to ask if they would like to talk by turning 
                        the card to green. The instructor can give the student the floor or turn the 
                        card back to red (can use a playing card if that is easier/on hand)</li>
                    </ul>
            <h4>Swearing or inappropriate comments</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>First incident: Warning. Let them know that those words may be okay in a 
                    different setting, but not this one. </li>
                <li>Second incident: Warning with note or call home </li>
                <li>Tips:</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>“We don’t talk like that to each other.” </li>
                    <li>“In this classroom we use formal language. The word you used is considered a 
                        swear room in my classroom and I don’t want to hear it again.” </li>
                    <li>Ask them a different way to express their thought</li>
                    <li>“Language please!”</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>How do we handle a child's misuse of the internet? </h4>
                <p>*** Use as a guideline! Situations may vary, especially with kids who have ADHD 
                    or other conditions, so make sure to account for those factors ***</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Less severe </li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>First incident: warning</li>
                        <li>Second incident: warning with note or call home </li>
                        <li>Third incident: warning with note or call home </li>
                        <li>Fourth incident: termination of class </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>More severe </li> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>First incident: warning with note or call home</li>
                            <li>Second incident: termination of class </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            <h4>What do we do if it does seem like one kid is being bullied? </h4>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.smartclassroommanagement.com/2011/06/25/bullying-in-the-classroom/">Resource on Bullying</a> </li>
                <li>Know what bullying is: “Bullying is the strong preying upon the weak. It can be 
                    a physical advantage or a social advantage. It can be one student or many. It 
                    often takes the form of threats, intimidation, repeated cruelty, and/or forcing 
                    someone against his or her will to do what the bully wants.” </li>
                <li>Separate bully from those bullied immediately: “Once you’re clear on the facts 
                    of the incident, and know who is responsible, act immediately. Separate the bully 
                    or bullies from their classmates in an in-class time-out. Tell them why, but don’t
                     lecture, scold, raise your voice, or even ask for a response.” </li>
                <li>Speak to the bully’s parents and the victim’s parents. </li>
                <li>Keep a close eye on both the bully and the victim for the rest of the week. </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>What if a child is not at all interested? (Ex. Just wants to sit in the corner 
                    and read) </h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Really tough to answer. Situational. Ideally, finding something the student can 
                    be excited by. At end of first day, discussing with parent. </li>
                <li>These kids will have phones. What if there is a prolonged amount of use on them? </li>
                <li>Only allowed use during breaks</li>
                <li>It may be best to have a strategy of collecting phones at the beginning of 
                    class and then returning them during breaks. Luke is okay with requiring the 
                    student to give up their phone if they are unable to refrain from using it. </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>These kids will have phones. What if there is a prolonged amount of use on them? </h4>

                    <li>It may be best to have a strategy of collecting phones at the beginning of

                        student to give up their phone if they are unable to refrain from using it. </li>
                </ul>
        
        <h3>Parent Policies</h3>
            <h4>What if a parent is being a bother? What if they want to sit in and watch us teach? </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>For safety reasons, I would suggest no parents are allowed to sit in and watch 
                    unless Luke is present. Someone needs to be around to “escort” him or her, and 
                    with an instructor teaching, that would leave us out of that position to do so. 
                    We never know what kind of dangers or situations could arise from a parent. We can 
                    kindly tell them that there is an opportunity to see what their child is doing on
                     Thursday when they can come in and see what they did. Also tell them that it 
                     is for safety purposes that they cannot sit in. </li>
                <li>Alternative answer: Let them stay for 30 minutes tops. From my own experience,
                     I feel uncomfortable when a parents tries to watch me teach. It feels like they 
                     are stepping on my toes and like I no longer have authority over the class (could 
                     be an age thing). </li>
            </ul>
                
                
        <h3>Checkout Policies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Site for check ins: <a href = "https://abamath-check-in.herokuapp.com/#!/" >here</a> </li>
                <li>At the beginning of class, you should know/ask a district official how the 
                    check-in/checkout system of the district works. Some districts have a camp system 
                    that will determine where you pick up and drop off the kids.</li>
                <li>For districts without a camp system, the kids will most likely be dropped off 
                    in the classroom by the parents. You should determine by the first parent where
                     you will drop off the kids/have them picked up in the classroom to keep consistency
                      for the remaining parents. </li>
                <li>At the end of the day, you must make sure the students’ spaces are clean.</li>
                <li>If the parents pick up the child in the classroom, you and the other instructor(s)
                     wait for every child to be picked up from the classroom </li>
                <li>If you walk the kids to a designated area, make sure you and the other 
                    instructor(s) walk the kids to that location together. You and the other 
                    instructor(s) must stay and watch to make sure every child gets picked up by
                     the correct car.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>If we have a bad feeling about who is picking a child up.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents should have to sign their child in and out unless they write a note 
                    with their signature saying otherwise. To pick up a child, a parent or guardian 
                    should have their ID (remind them of this when they drop off their kid), and on our
                     roster we should have a list of eligible pick-up people. If someone comes in and 
                     tries to pick up their child and their name is not on the list, we call someone 
                     who is on the list to confirm if it is okay or not. Instructor or parent then 
                     writes down the time the child arrives and leaves. This could be helpful for 
                     legal reasons if we are blamed for something during a time we were not in charge 
                     of the kid. Safety should be our number one priority and although it may be more
                      of a hassle for parents and us as well, I think they will appreciate our attention
                       to detail and safety in doing so. </li>
                    <li>Get a school official, if necessary. It is always safe to have multiple people
                         involved in a situation like this.</li>
                    <li>Definitely call police if we have a bad feeling about someone picking a child up. 
                        If you have a co-instructor, ask for their judgment on the situation as well 
                        before calling. </li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Emergency Policies</h3>
            <h4>First aid</h4>
                <ul><li>I think CPR/First Aid training would be a good investment for this company to make
                     with their instructors. It’s possible some people have an up-to-date certification 
                     already. I believe it’s as crucial as running a background check. </li></ul>
            <h4>First aid examples</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tweezers - use to take out splinters or bee stingers </li>
                    <li>Ice pack - use if a child is complaining of a pain or after they get stung 
                        by a bee </li>
                    <li>Bandaids - use for minor scrapes and bumps </li>
                    <li>Hydrocortisone - use for minor pains, swelling, itching, and discomfort </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Emergency situations - if there was a fire, tornado, etc. </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically, rosters can be found on Eleyo. Every instructor should print a hard 
                        copy roster of their class with names, allergies/important information, emergency
                         contact information, and parents/guardian names before the class starts. </li>
                    <li>In case of a fire, escort your class to a safe location and 
                        count your kids / check your roster when you arrive. Let someone know if you 
                        don’t have your whole class. Never leave the kids alone. By having parents sign 
                        their child in and out, we can quickly see if a child didn’t come that day or 
                        if they are indeed somewhere else. </li>
                    <li>In case of a tornado, escort your class to a safe location and count your
                         kids / check your roster when you arrive. Let someone know if you don’t have
                          your whole class. Never leave the kids alone. By having parents sign their 
                          child in and out, we can quickly see if a child didn’t come that day or if 
                          they are indeed somewhere else. </li>
                    <li>In case of an active shooter situation, your best option is leave the building 
                        and don’t be a sitting duck. Getting away from the shooter or shooters is top 
                        priority. Leave everything except your roster behind. Help other escape, if 
                        possible, but evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Prevent your 
                        class from going where the active shooter may be. Call 911 when you are safe. </li>
                    <li>If leaving isn’t an option, hide. Tell your class to stay very quiet and ensure 
                        that all phones are off and won’t vibrate. Lock and block doors, close blinds, 
                        and turn off the lights. Don’t hide in groups; spread out along wall or hide 
                        separately to make it harder for the shooter. Try to communicate silently with 
                        the police by sending a text or tagging your location on social media. Stay in
                         place until you get the all clear from officials. </li>

            <h4>Lost child procedure?</h4>
                    <li>Hasn’t happened. Immediate outreach to community education. Could depend on 
                        how/when it happened. </li>


        <h3>Other Policies</h3>
            <h4>Bathroom procedures and rules</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to bring the whole group during designated break time (at least one every
                         90 minutes).</li>
                    <li>If there are 2 instructors and it’s not break time, one instructor can ask for 
                        a bathroom call. Always bring more than one child even if only one has to go. 
                        If it’s an emergency and it’s only you, bring the whole class. </li>
                    <li>Never go into a stall with a child, even with it unlocked. </li>
                    <li>Shouldn’t be a problem with our age groups, but if a younger child is having a 
                        hard time zipping or buttoning their pants, try to talk them through it. If there
                         is an absolute need for help, have another adult be a spotter. This could help
                          in legal situations. </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>What do we do with extra time? </h4>
                <ul><li>Typically extend free work time, or look to ICE plans</li></ul>

            <h4>Printing Policy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who prints: The person in charge of printing will be assigned for the summer</li>
                    <li>Where to print: The printing person may choose a location to print (ie local 
                        library or FedEx/OfficeMax), location should be used consistently</li>
                    <li>One-time prints: For one time prints (eg a new activity/curriculum update), 
                        email the document and number of copies needed to the printing person. 
                        These will be distributed at Team Tuesday meeting </li>
                    <li>Recurring prints(eg end of class handouts/flyers): </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strategy 1: Each week, on Friday, instructors should email the printing
                                 person with the documents they need and the number of copies(based on 
                                 their roster and including copies for potential last minute adds). 
                                 These will be distributed on Team Tuesday</li>
                            <li>Strategy 2: Have the printing person do the work outlined above for all
                                 instructors for the week</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
