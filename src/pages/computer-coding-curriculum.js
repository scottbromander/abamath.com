            Computer Coders
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ever wanted to learn to code? Here&#39; your chance! Computer Coders will teach you your
        very first programming language. Take your pick of languages that have helped build
        Facebook, YouTube, Google, and more! Start by learning the basics of syntax and work
        yourself up to creating projects and games. Time away from the screen in fun, collaborative
        activities that will teach the basics of concepts like cryptography, binary,
        and compression.
      </p>

      <h5>Timeline</h5>
      <p>Four 3-hour days for a total of 12 hours of curriculum for 3rd - 6th graders</p>

      <h5>By the end of the class, students will be able to</h5>
      <p>Create code using functions</p>
      <p>Create code using if statements</p>
      <p>Create code using variables</p>
      <p>Describe computer programming</p>
      <p>Describe what types of problems they can solve with computer science</p>
      <p>Describe what kinds of commands you can give to computers</p>
      <p>Describe binary and why it matters in computer science</p>
      <p>Describe what strings are and why are they useful</p>
      <p>Describe what lists, dictionaries, and trees are</p>
      <p>Describe what boolean values are</p>
      <p>Describe sorting and types of sorting</p>

      <h5>Basic Structure</h5>
      <p>
        Each day is split up into two, 90-minute blocks. Each of these blocks has its own
        “CS Unplugged” activity where small groups are taken away from their computers to learn
        a computer coding concept. The students not working on one of the CS Unplugged activities
        with the coach work through the Learn Python on codecademy.com.

          Mars Rover  - Ask for a volunteer to be the Rover. The Rover should close their eyes
          and stand at the front of the room/hallway. Have other students create a path using
          their chairs as boundaries. Place 3 objects throughout the course. Taking turns, the
          student should direct the Rover(whose eyes are still closed) through the obstacles
          to retrieve and bring back all the objects. Tell the class that they cannot touch
          the Rover or move the 3 objects If there are 2+ instructors, one can be the rover
          and the other can moderate.

          Instruction - Go through examples of binary numbers on the board. Explain what the
          0s and 1s mean and how the bits are weighted.If students are interested, you can also
          explain adding/subtracting in binary
        </li>
        <li><OutboundLink href="">Binary Presentation</OutboundLink></li>
        <li>
          Binary Numbers - Make 2 sets of 15 note cards numbered 1-15. Split the team up into
          two lines behind the note cards placed upside-down on two chairs. The first person in
          line writes the number in binary on the board, on another sheet, or with the cards.
          If they get it right, the instructor takes the card. If they get it wrong, they have
          to put the note card back for another student to try. After each guess, the player
          moves to the back of the line. First team to finish all 15 cards wins. (works best
          with 2 instructors, one for each team)

        <ul>
          <li>Learning computer programming is similar to learning a new language </li>
          <li>
            Just like there are many languages spoken and written in the world, there are
            many different computer languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Different programming languages do different things. For example, to build a
            website you might use the languages Python, HTML, CSS or JavaScript. For a
            mobile app, you might use Java or Objective C. For video games, you might use
            C++. The language that is selected depends on what you are trying to create
            and what you are trying to get the computer to do.

          Sorting Algorithms - Give the coders eight cards (Ace through 8, out of order).
          The coders take turns asking about two cards. They can ask, “Which card is larger?” or
          “Are these cards in order?” and then the next coder can ask. Here are two methods for
          comparison:

          <li>
            Best if done in group of 4/5 in a circle fashion. Give students an incentive

            First divide the

            each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists.
            Finally all the elements are sorted and merged.

            <li> Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array. </li>
            <li>
              Partitioning: reorder the array so that all elements with values less than
              the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than
              the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this
              partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition
              operation.

            <li>
              Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller
