            2018 Website Creation
      </h1>

      <h4>Description:</h4>
      <p>
        Explore the fundamentals of website design by learning HTML and CSS.
        By the end of the week, you will be able to create your very own website,
        whether it’s a spot to showcase your talent, a photo/video blog, or
        a joke site! Mixed into the code is time away from the screen learning
        basics of binary, hexadecimal, and user experience and interface.
      </p>

      <h4>Timeline</h4>
      <p>Four 3-hour days for a total of 12 hours of curriculum for 7th - 9th graders</p>
      <p>Day 1 - Website Intro and HTML</p>
      <p>Day 2 - UX/UI and HTML</p>
      <p>Day 3 - CSS</p>
      <p>Day 4 - Build Time</p>

      <h4>By the end of the class, students will be able to</h4>
      <p>Create HTML and CSS scripts</p>
      <p>Describe user interface and user experience</p>
      <p>Describe different website navigation tools</p>
      <p>Develop their own website</p>

          Pair Investigation - Students will form pairs to explore website design.
          Instruct them to find a store, school, and company website.
          Students should identify key website elements as discussed previously as
          well as unique elements that they find interesting on the individual websites.
          Have students note differences between the website structures
          (eg what tabs does each website have? Is there more text or pictures?).
          Instructor should rotate between groups to facilitate conversation

          Brainstorm Personal Website -
          Students will brainstorm about the website they would like to build.
          Instructor should also ensure that all ideas fit within expectations and rules.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First ~15 minutes have students brainstorm 10 ideas.
            If students finish this quicker than others, have
            them think of website content
          </li>
          <li>
            For ~5 minutes, instruct students to choose one final topic and
            think about what might go on it

        </ul>
        <li>Computer science fun fact of the day: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Learning computer programming is similar to learning a new language </li>
          <li>
            Just like there are many languages spoken and written in the world,
            there are many different computer languages.
          </li>
          <li>
              Different programming languages do different things.
              For example, to build a website you might use the
              languages Python, HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
              For a mobile app, you might use Java, Objective C, or Swift.
              For video games, you might use C++. The language that is selected depends on what
              you are trying to create and what you are trying to get the computer to do.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Students continue to work on Learn HTML </li>

            begin HTML Document Standards lessons
          </li>
          <li>
            **Note: If students seem to be struggling a lot doing website design,
            start them with code.org or python lessons in codecademy, and when they
            feel more comfortable, they can return to HTML and CSS lessons
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Stretches</li>
        <li>3/4ths Break - Stand Up / Sit Down Game</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
              As a break (you judge when it is needed), play the stand up / sit down game.
              To play, you say “Stand up if… you have been out of the country” or other examples.
              If they are cool statements, ask the students to elaborate
              on where they’ve been or whatever fits the question.

          This will include how to make a flow diagram for the website as well as
          blocking out content.
          Then the students will develop UI/UX schematics for their own website
