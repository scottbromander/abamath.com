Rules we would like them to guess themselves (if not, lead them that direction until
                they can guess)

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be respectful and encouraging - help each other out</li>
      <li>Use your indoor voices, this is a computer lab</li>
      <li>If you have a question, raise your hand</li>
      <li>Donâ€™t touch others computers (we want them to learn on their own!)</li>
      <li>Stay on the websites we are working on</li>
      <li>At the end of class, clean your space</li>
      <li>
        Remember you are using school property,
        so you are responsible for the property you use for the week
      </li>
      <li>
          Explain the class structure: Break halfway (Snacks, Bathroom, Outside?)
          and Hands-on Activities
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Hallway Procedures:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Important! Be sure to set expectations BEFORE you leave the room. </li>
      <li>Expectations:</li>

      <li>We walk and keep our hands to ourselves</li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>We will take bathroom breaks</li>
