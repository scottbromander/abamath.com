        Coding For Kids
      </h1>
      <p>
        Have you heard of Code Thinking? It&#39;s the way programmers think!
        Learn code thinking and the basics of programming using blocks like counters,
        loops, functions, and variables. Use your new knowledge to solve puzzles on screen
        with time  away from the screen in fun activities to learn concepts like binary and
        cryptography. Please come knowing how to navigate the internet (basic typing and
        mouse control) and a passion to work hard and have fun!
      </p>

      <h5>Timeline</h5>
      <p>Four 3-hour days for a total of 12 hours of curriculum for 3rd - 6th graders</p>

      <h5>By the end of the class, students will be able to</h5>
      <p>Create code using Loops</p>
      <p>Create code using if statements</p>
      <p>Create code using variables</p>
      <p>Describe computer programming</p>
      <p>Describe what types of problems they can solve with computer science</p>
      <p>Describe what kinds of commands you can give to computers</p>
      <p>Describe binary and why it matters in computer science</p>
      <p>Describe encryption and what it is used for</p>
      <p>Describe compression and what it does to images</p>

      <h5>Terminology</h5>
      <p>Coders - Students enrolled in the class</p>
      <p>Coach/You - Instructor leading the class</p>

      <h5>Basic Structure</h5>
      <p>
        Each day is split up into two, 90-minute blocks. Each of these blocks has its own
        “CS Unplugged” activity where small groups are taken away from their computers to learn
        a computer coding concept. The students not working on one of the CS Unplugged activities
        with the coach work through the “Accelerated Course” on code.org.

          Harold the Robot Activity  - Randomly layout a collection of plastic or paper
          cups onto a table.  They can be upright, upside down, side ways, etc. The students must
          use verbal commands to instruct what the ‘robot’
          (either the instructor or another student)
          will do to manipulate and stack the cups into a pyramid.  Each student will give
          instructions to the ‘robot’, and students must work together to figure out what
          instructions the ‘robot’ will follow.  The ‘robot’ is free to decide what instructions
          they will follow, the only requirement is that the ‘robot’ is consistent.
          If instructions are too complex or unclear, the ‘robot’ will become confused and
          visibly show this by shaking their head or slumping there head into their hands.

          Just Dance loops activity - Begin the activity by reminding students that we see loops
          in real life all the time. Have students break into group of 2/3. One at a time, have the
          students complete one of the Just Dance videos on YouTube.
          After the song is over, ask each student to define a loop they used when dancing.
          When all students have gone, emphasize the difference between repeat loops and
          conditional loops.For example, in the songs,
          we weren&#39;t counting how many times we did a certain action.
          Instead, we did it UNTIL a condition (ie a change in rhythm) was satisfied.

        <li>Computer science fun facts of the day: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Programming can be done by yourself or in a group</li>
          <li>It’s never too early or too late in your life to start coding </li>
          <li>
            A computer program is a group of instructions or a bunch of lines of code that execute
            a specific task.
            This could be as simple as calculating a few numbers or could be more complex,
            like building Facebook. Websites, games, and apps are all examples of computer programs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Sorting Algorithms - Give the coders eight cards (Ace through 8, out of order). The coders
          take turns asking about two cards. They can ask, “Which card is larger?”
          or “Are these cards in order?”
          and then the next coder can ask. Here are two methods for comparison:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li><OutboundLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVMKXKoGu_Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVMKXKoGu_Y</OutboundLink></li>
          <li>
            Kids typically figure out the first one (called selection sort).
            But there are faster ways!
            Quick sort is the other one in the video, and that is a faster way to sort a list.
            Keep track of who solves it in the shortest number of questions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Have students at least get through the Farmer 2 levels on code.org.
          Once students finish this set of levels, if students seem to be moving quickly through
          code.org or seem to be getting bored, they seem to like codecombat.com. Have them make
          an account using the same information as their code.org account in order to save progress.

          after break to help them stay focused.

        </li>
        <li>
          Binary Numbers - Each student gets 5 cards (Ace, 2, 4, 8, King - the king is a 16).
          Explain to the students that if a card is face up, it is on, it is a one.
          If it is face down, it is off, it is a zero. With just 5 ones and zeroes,
          let’s see what kind of numbers we can make. Can you make a 4? Can you make a 0?
          What is the largest number you can make with these cards?
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easy way to explain binary: to add 1, starting with Ace, keep flipping cards until
            you flip one face-up.

            How can you be reasonably confident that nobody will steal your credit card number
            while you are shopping online? (network security, cryptography)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Binary Competition: The goal of this activity is to allow students to practice converting
          numbers to binary, with competition as incentive.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Method 1 (two instructors, one for each team): Make 2 sets of 15 note cards numbered
            1-15. Split the team up into two lines behind the note cards placed upside-down on two
            chairs. The first person in line writes the number in binary on the board, on another
            sheet, or with the cards. If they get it right, the instructor takes the card. If they
            get it wrong, they have to put the note card back for another student to try. After each
            attempt, the player moves to the back of the line.
            First team to finish all 15 cards wins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Method 2 (one instructor): If there is only one teacher, rather than checking if the
            answers are correct on the fly, it could make more sense to simply give the students a
            set amount of time and once the time is up the number of correct answers may be counted.
            This has the added benefit that the first team to finish won&#39;t be sitting around
            waiting for the other.
          </li>
          <li>Pro tip: have all the binary conversions written down for a quick way to check </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Word Compression - Coders split into teams of two. One person from each team is given a
          word and told that they must remove 2 letters and write that on a piece of paper.
          If they are successful, give the students a new word and tell them they must remove 3
          letters. See how many letters they can remove from these words.

            How can high-quality photos, audio, and video be compressed so much (1/10 to 1/100
            of original size) without losing much quality? (lossy compression algorithms)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Making an Algorithm- Students should each be given an algorithm to make a folded paper
          creation. They will have 5 minutes and 1 piece of paper to follow the instructions. All
          algorithms are medium hardness so students will definitely run into at least one point of
          confusion. Have students turn in their creations when done.
          As a class, discuss how it felt
          reading the instructions and following them when unsure. Reference how confusion can come
          about when certain terms(or variables) are undefined in our algorithm. If students would
          like, they may do another round or try and recreate using the original instructions with
          pictures.
