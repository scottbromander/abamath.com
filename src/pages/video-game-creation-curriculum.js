          2018 Video Game Creation Camp Lesson Plan
      </h1>
      <p>
          Make your own video game! From Pong to Maze games, you&#39;ll learn to code
          then put those skills to use. Using an MIT built platform, you&#39;ll create
          your custom online game to share with friends and family. Please come knowing
          how to navigate the internet (basic typing and mouse control) and a passion
          to work hard and have fun!
      </p>

      <h5>Timeline</h5>
      <p>Four 3-hour days for a total of 12 hours of curriculum for 6th - 9th graders</p>

      <h5>Objectives</h5>
      <p>To be able to create a video game using Scratch</p>
      <p>To be able to describe “Flow” and the impact it has in a game</p>
      <p>To be able to describe “Game balancing” and why it matters in a game</p>
      <p>
        To be able to define what a video game is: A video game is an electronic game that
        involves player interaction.
      </p>
      <h5>Basic Structure</h5>
      <p>
        Each day consists of multiple guided instruction sections where the coach will lead the
        coders through a Scratch example and then be given time to improve that example and make
        it their own with the instructor offering assistance and answering questions. On the
        final day, there is no guided instruction in order to give students time to complete
        their “Final Project”.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Explain to the students that Scratch is a platform built for all ages to use;
            however, we are going to &#34;level it up&#34; for them because they are older
            and can handle the more complex (aka fun) parts of Scratch
          </li>
          <li>Vocab </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If-statements - allows the computer to check a condition and decide whether to do
              something, run code if something is true or false
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>They can be read “if this is true, then do this” </li>
              <li>
                Every “if-block” needs a condition, which we will be using in just a few minutes
              </li>
              <li>Example: If PacMan touches an enemy, then he loses his life</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Brainstorm - 30 min </li>
        <li>Make Scratch Accounts</li>
        <li>Have Students create a new project - This is their in class project</li>

        </li>
        <li>Lesson 1 - Intro to Scratch</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Create new project, and name it! </li>
          <li>
            Show where the duplicate, delete, grow, and shrink buttons are, then delete
            the default sprite (cat).
          </li>
          <li>Next, add a sprite, then a background!</li>
          <li>We first need to initialize the stage.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Initialization is the term for giving a variable a starting value.</li>
            <li>
              This is important because when we start a game we don’t always know
              what a certain variable is set to, so this allows up to reset it to
              the proper value.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may remember that last time we created a moving character, but
              there was no way to “restart” the game. This will allow us to do that.
            </li>
            <li>
              Describe how the Green Flag button will be our restart button. It will
              run the code below when you start the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try having the students drag their character away from their starting
              spot and see how each time the program is reset with the flag they are
              returned to the proper location.

              Challenge #1: Use the arrow keys to make your sprite move.
              Hint: Use change x and y blocks.
            </li>
            <li>Challenge #2: Create another sprite, and make it start in random places.</li>

        <li>Computer science fun fact of the day: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How come modern games look so rad, with all of their cool 3-D effects, and
            how can it all be rendered in real-time as you are playing and constantly
            changing the in-game environment? (computer graphics)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Conditionals Activity - OPTIONAL (pick one) </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conditionals Competition - Split students into 2 teams. The person at the
            front of the line will pick up a card and show it to the instructor. They
            will then perform the appropriate action based on the card&#39;s conditions. If they
            are correct, the team gets a point. If not, the card goes back in the stack.
            Continue until all cards are complete.

              Alternative Way to Play: Say the cards and play a “Simon says”
              game of sorts. No one needs to get eliminated, but you can
              still call them out if they get it wrong.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Conditionals Chain Game </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Have students get into a circle</li>
            <li>Explain the game as a story of chained events. Here is an example: </li>
            <ul>
              <li>“If I go out tonight… I will go to the movie.”</li>
              <li>
                “If I go to the movie… I will see Charlie and the Chocolate
                factory.”
              </li>
              <li>
                “If I see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory… I will eat
                lots of chocolate.”
              </li>
              <li>“If I eat lots of chocolate… I will gain weight.” </li>
              <li>“If I gain weight… I will have to go to the gym more.” </li>
              <li>Etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Start the game with an if statement (If I drink coffee…) and the
              person on your right has to finish it (...then I will stay up
              tonight). Then that person starts the next statement with the
              statement they just created (If I stay up tonight…). Continue in
              the circle until the story seems to be dying down or when excitement
              diminishes. You can start a new statement when that occurs.
            </li>
          </ul>

                          Active Conditionals Game
            </OutboundLink>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, this might be a better game to play outside or in an open
              space.
            </li>
            <li>
              For every round, where each person gets 3 statements, there is one
              Programmer and everyone else is a Computer.  The Programmer stands
              in front of the Computers and gives them his command.  If
              I ____ (fill in the blank), then you _____ (fill in the blank).
              For example, the Programmer below gave the command “If I turn in
              a circle, Then you turn in a circle.”
            </li>
            <li>
              Moving on up the grade levels, you can move on up the coding
              complexity too with If-Then-Else statements.  For example, the
              Programmer commands “If I raise my right arm, Then you raise your
              left arm, Else raise your right foot.”  So if he just stands there
              and does nothing, the Computers should all be raising their right
              foot.  This gets pretty funny, pretty fast.
            </li>

          <li>Conditionals</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make a balloon sprite</li>
            <li>
              Everyone’s game should have at least two sprites (the player sprite
              and the balloon sprite) with only the initialization code (the other
              code should can be deleted from lesson 1).
            </li>
            <li>Use conditionals to change how the player moves:</li>

                <li>When you press w, you move up</li>
                <li>When you press s, you move down</li>
                <li>When you press a, you turn left</li>
                <li>When you press d, you turn right</li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              You can make a dart by choose a pencil sprite in the library,
              filling it in in the color, and shrinking it very small

            <li>Explain why you need a clone (to make more ammo shoot) </li>
            <li>
              When you make the clone, then describe that you set the dart to
              come from the player sprite.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, explain that repeat until touching edge will keep moving
              until it hits the edge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, you must delete the clone, so your game does not lag
              from too many.

      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Intro</li>
        <li>
          Explanation of flow: A video game is not fun if it is too easy. A video game is not
          fun if it is too hard. Video game “Flow” is all about making the game fun by
          making it just hard enough to keep it challenging.
        </li>
        <li>Lesson 3 - Variables and Operators</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Score, Timer, Lives</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make a variable block in the data section called “HP”, “Lives”,
              or “Health”
            </li>
            <li>
              In the player sprite, set your health and change your lives, if
              touching balloon.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Win Condition/Game Over</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make a “Game Over” screen from the paintbrush under the backdrop
              section.
            </li>
            <img src={videogame31} alt="make 'game over' background" height="300" />
            <li>
              If your health gets to 0 or less, switch to the Game over screen,
              hide the player, and stop the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since you want to start with the backdrop on the original, make
              sure you initialize the backdrop by putting a “switch backdrop
              to” block at the beginning of the code.
            </li>
            <li>Player code </li>
            <img src={videogame32} alt="player code" height="500" />
            <li>
              Also, make sure you initialize the player by adding show when
              flag is clicked.
            </li>
            <li>Describe some of the operator blocks</li>
            <li>
              Now, go to the dart sprite as we are gonna make the darts scatter
              more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, we are going to have the darts disappear when they touch the
              balloon. Dart Code
            </li>
            <img src={videogame33} alt="dart code" height="400" />
            <li>
              Now, go to the player sprite, and add a timer code that goes up by
              1 second as the game continues.
            </li>
            <li>Player code</li>

            <li>
              Take time to discuss slowly and make sure all the kids are on the
              same page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Delete the touching balloon from player script (the code in the
              circle), because you will add that on the balloon page (so multiple
              balloons will do more damaging when touching).
            </li>
            <li>
              Start with the hide block, then the wait 1 or 2 secs to create the
              AI balloon.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, discuss how the AI balloon is like making clones of the dart,
              but now they come at random times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, describe that the balloon may come from the left (x=-200) or
              right (x=200) at random height (y). Then, they appear and move
              towards the player.
            </li>
            <li>Also, if your balloon ever gets hit by the dart then you delete him.</li>
            <li>Now, add the balloons popped variable by setting and changing it.</li>

              <li>
                Challenge #2: Make different guns. Hint: Duplicate the dart
                code and change it!

          Explanation of game balancing: Game balancing is all about making a game fair for
          all of the players. If a game is fair, then it is called, “balanced.” Ask the coders
          if they know why this is important?
        </li>
        <li>Lesson 5 - Upgrades</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Make a new sprite named boss. Boss Code: </li>
          <img src={bossCode} height="400" alt="boss code" />
          <li>Make variables level and Boss HP </li>
          <li>Describe in detail how when you pop the boss balloon, your level increases. </li>
          <li>
            When your level increases, the time the boss regenerates
            increases by 5 times and the next
            boss’s health increases by 2 times its old HP, so it gets harder!
          </li>
          <li>
            You must go to the Dart code, and change it for when you are touching the boss.
            Dart code:
          </li>
          <img src={dartCode} height="350" alt="dart code" />

          <li>Add Admin tools on the player sprite! Player code:</li>
          <img src={playerCode} height="400" alt="player code" />
          <li>Improvement Time </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Challenge #1: Try changing out the boss’s stats</li>
            <li>Challenge #2: Make the background switch when the level switches</li>
            <li>
              Challenge #3: Continue to add admin specialties (better gun?) and add your
              friends as admins!

        <li>Computer science fun fact of the day: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How is it possible for you and dozens of other people to play online simultaneously
            and still have the game feel responsive most of the time? (networking, client-server
            architecture)
          </li>

        </ul>
        <li>
          Networks game: Have students break into groups of 4, 2 players form a team.
          Give each group a set of Networks Card. Students will take turns trying to
          get the other player to guess what the word on the card is without using
          hand gestures or &#34;banned words&#34;. The other team keeps score by counting how
          many word hints the non-guessing player had to give. Once the guesser gets
          the word correct, the other team goes. Lowest score wins.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Concept: sometimes your networks lag. This is because the networks
            have to send out so much data to different computers at the same time
            and it sometimes overlaps. This is like how our &#34;banned words&#34; can&#39;t
            get through because of &#34;collisions&#34;
          </li>

            When you type in words on a search engine&#39;s web page, how does it give you
            back the results so quickly? (search algorithms, parallel computing)

            How can the retailer accurately predict what other items you might like to buy
            based on what you&#39;ve recently bought? (artificial intelligence, machine learning)

          Parallel Processing Guessing Game - Students play this game as a class. Have the
          class line up horizontally across the board. Each round is a 6 letter word of your
          choice. Draw 6 dashes on the board where you will fill in the letters
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For the first round, go down the line and have each student take a guess at
            what the first letter is. If it&#39;s correct fill it in. If not, go to the
            next student. Do this for each letter and tally how many guesses it takes
            to get the whole word
          </li>
          <li>
            For the second round, play like traditional hangman where the guesses can
            apply to any letter in the word. This is the &#34;parallel processing
            version&#34;
          </li>
